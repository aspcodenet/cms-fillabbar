In this chapter we will take a look at the basic programming terminology and we will write our first 
C# program. We will familiarize ourselves with programming – what it means and its connection to 
computers and programming languages.

Briefly, we will review the different stages of software development.

We will introduce the C# language, the .NET platform and the different Microsoft technologies used in 
software development. We will examine what tools we need to program in C#. We will use the 
C# language to write our first computer program, compile and run it from the command line as well as 
from Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment. We will review the MSDN 
Library – the documentation of the .NET Framework. It will help us with our exploration of 
the features of the platform and the language.
